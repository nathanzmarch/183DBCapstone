the end to end result
characterize each step independently
make a claim that we need x vertices in a surface?
Where did this number come from?
What does smoothness mean?
min angle? -> min distance?
how have you solved that problem?
-> supporting the claim with quantitative data
how to characterize, validate
numbers too big -> right sig figs
place the numbers in context
basically use number to support claim

given the graph what is it supporting?

Need to support our claims with data ->
what conclusion can be drawn from data 

comprehensiveness -> generate support for claims that you make
figure out how to address this -> run more experiments, fix bugs
characterize how you present the system to make sure that everything aligns

what did you learn from the attempt -> this is not achievable in another tool

if there is engineering value gained from getting to that point 

how did i get hear conceptually

we did this -> lets go

integration question how to integrate blender in webots
if it took your engineering expertise to solve

what is it that the reader wants to get from you
what are they going to get out of it

characterization we need to do

formalize the subdivision complexity

instead of drawing the tattoo -> draw squares
if we draw it on the arm

heres what people care about
heres math to give them what they want

resolution
uniformity
linearity
