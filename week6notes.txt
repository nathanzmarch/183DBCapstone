image processing not that worth it

we need to focus on the main issue of projection and arm planning so that it doesn't go through the person

we don't know about the color, angle of the pen? 

don't want to worry about color right now.

making sure that the tip doesn't go through the surface

make sure the pen is perpendicular to the surface while drawing

metric to characterize how effectively we solved the problem.

not a successful path plan because not perpendicular?
